# Background: 
# Little Codey is an interplanetary space boxer, who is trying to win championship belts for various weight categories on other planets within the solar system. Remember, the force of gravity is different on each planet, so your weight will be different for each planet. 

# Write a space.py program that helps Codey keep track of their target weight by:
# Checks which number planet is equal to.

# It should then compute their weight on the destination planet.
# Here is the table of conversion:
# #	Planet		Relative Gravity
# 0	Mercury	90%
# 1	Venus		91%
# 2	Mars		38%
# 3	Jupiter		234%
# 4	Saturn		106%
# 5	Uranus		92%
# 6	Neptune	119%
# 7	Pluto		6.3% (Yes Pluto is a planet, according to the Sekol Science Center who grew up in the 80's and refuses to access the IAU's reclassification of Pluto to a Dwarf Planet)

# Requirements:
# User inputs weight on earth.
# The program converts the weight on Earth to the weight on each planet above. 
# Program outputs: new weight for each planet.
